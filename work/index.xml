      <description>Search for health app ui on pinterest and you will find 9 of 10 examples use a white/cyan color scheme, have minimalistic graphs and beautifully type-set numbers, but not a lot of human.
Sterile sci-fi fantasy is not what healthcare looks like nor should aspire to be. I refuse to accept the sterile sci-fi fantasy aesthetic. It is dehumanizing.

      <description>The map was inspired by a passage in Walter Benjamin’s _Arcades Project_ where he describes a 19th century map of Paris known as the Plan Taride, which unlike the flimsy paper maps of the day, was a miniature fully-bound book.
 
Content Highlights 38 spots around the city, including the best tea shop in Chinatown, a mini-park 11 stories in the air, a private library, and a bunch of amazing restaurants.</description>
