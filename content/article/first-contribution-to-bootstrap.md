[Mark Otto](http://markdotto.com) merged my [first pull request](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/11536) into Bootstrap. Just some additional CSS to add previously unsupported button dropdowns to justified button groups. Here's a demo.

<iframe width="100%" height="192" src="http://jsfiddle.net/5kFx6/3/embedded/result,html,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

If you are using the latest [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) (> v3.0.3) it has five lines of my code in it!
